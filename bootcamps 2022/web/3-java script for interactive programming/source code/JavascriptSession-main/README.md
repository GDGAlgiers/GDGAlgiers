### Basics
by basics i mean all the fundamental and must known concepts starting from how to 
apply the javascript code in the html page, data types, variables scope, strings output ..

### Arrays
In this section we will see what are arrays in javascript, what are their 
functionalities  and what are the principal methods to use in order to use arrays 
and benefits from their avantages

### DOM
The DOM know as document object model is the structure of a web page which is represented as a tree 
containing all elements in nodes, with javascript we will see how to modify this tree and therefore 
modify the webpage (this includes targeting an element and modify it classes or properties ..)

### Events
events in javascript are availble permantely, from loading the page to manipulating it, so on when the user click a 
button the click is an event and using javascript we will capture that event and target the element which triggered 
that event, then we must handle that event.***
### Exercice
Ias a last thing we created a todo list app, the main functionalities are adding a task, deleting a task, marking a 
task as completed.in this code we used most of what we have learned in the workshop and we applied it to have a basic
