### Frankly speaking, I thought it was merely impossible to compress all these thoughts and emotions into this lol, but here goes nothing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Dearest community,

First things first, allow me to describe how spectacular this season was, it is hands down one of the best, if not the best season **GDG&WTM Algiers** have ever witnessed. Through the events we hosted and the projects we executed, we have illustrated so much innovation, hard work, creativity, and most importantly a remarkable impact on the community as a whole because as important as it could be to sophisticate our activities, I’m a firm believer that **“quality”** is majorly measured by how much benefit they can emit. And guess what? Our work throughout the season has been straight-up phenomenal and extraordinary, kudos to you all!
But honestly, all the attendees we got, all the praise we received, all the audience we gained, they don’t compare to the achievement that I personally consider the most valuable of them all: we built a family out of it. 💛

I can’t express how thankful I am that I got to be part of this journey for another season and witness it from a lead perspective, truly thank you all for trusting me with this position and for giving me the opportunity and the absolute honor to see and manage things differently. I’m walking out of this journey as a whole different person who’s learned so much from the ups and downs and most importantly from you guys and from your desire for sharing. As much as I’m still in disbelief of the honor that’s been assigned to me, I’m most grateful for it, and I hope I haven’t disappointed your trust nor done any of you wrong, I sincerely apologize if that was ever the case.

The success that GDG&WTM Algiers are witnessing is crafted by your own hands and has become a reality thanks to the passion you hold for learning and generously broadcasting your knowledge to everyone else. I want to thank each and every one of you for every drop of effort that has been put into this, I know that getting through studies on its own is a challenge, but regardless of that you have dedicated time, energy, and effort to this community, & that’s why you’re called **“Community Heroes”** 🎩. I pray that you will be rewarded for every beneficial thing you’ve taught someone else and I hope that the passion and dedication for sharing within you will last for a lifetime, and not just tech-wise.

Work aside, I would also like to express my gratitude for the support and care I’ve been receiving from you guys since the very beginning. It’s been a tough year indeed but your presence has contributed so much to making it easier, I’m grateful for the quick encounters at school, for the fun we have at the spot (which I will miss so so freaking much), for the memories we made at the events, for your encouragements, your love, for sharing the graduation joy with me, and for every second I’ve spent it with you guys. Hopefully, I will attend your graduations myself one day Inch’Allah, I cannot wait for that!
Simply put, you guys have made this last year of mine a trillion times more special, you’ve all been hands down the most precious thing about it, and I can never thank Allah enough for every single thing.

Of course, I can never forget the support GDG&WTM’s alumni have been providing for the community, they’ve always been so encouraging, supportive and never hesitant to share their thoughts and advice with us, which makes them one of the biggest reasons this community has reached so high. My sincere thankfulness to each one of them, you know yourselves 💛 

If I may share some advice of mine for the upcoming generations: 
* Never hesitate to try out new things and think outside the box, you guys have a potential of gold and you should definitely exploit it to the fullest because I guarantee you that this is the best chance for you to do so. Seize the opportunity and unleash your creativity!
* The image of GDG&WTM has always been impeccable, make sure to keep it that way. Please always stay kind and respectful to one another, this is considered a safe place for so many people and we definitely don’t want it to change.
As Akram always says, generations may change but GDG&WTM’s image and special atmosphere should never be touched, that’s what makes us who we are and that’s what we should always protect so تناصحوا فيما بينكم please 💛

I have absolutely no doubt that the next season will be on fire and that the next team will raise the bar even higher Inch’Allah, I cannot wait to see that and I hope I can get the pleasure to see you guys again and be part of this journey as much as I can 💛

Last but not least, I wish you all the best in your studies/professional career, rebi ywefe9kom w yweffe9 this community lkol khir and may you always contribute to making others a little happier by the day 💛 You will always have my support so never hesitate to reach out to me if you need help with anything or if the slightest of things bother you, I’m always ears! 

Thank you so much for everything once again, and I’m sorry

**Sincerely yours, 💛**
